  "You just got ratio’d by a JPEG.",
  "Even Buff wouldn’t take credit for this cut.",
  "This is worse than a Glamy apology arc.",
  "You missed harder than Boogie trying to adult.",
  "This split is more uneven than the LCU cast’s screen time.",
  "Was this cut sponsored by rage bait?",
  "You're not even low-tier cringe. You're just sad.",
  "This is why Keem won’t cover you.",
  "Even the greys have more precision than that.",
  "You cut like a glitched NPC.",
  "Somewhere, a Voldemort just rolled their eyes.",
  "This makes Sweet Tea's look put-together.",
  "Your ratio is more tragic than a cancelled collab."

var paMessages1 = [
  "You're cutting like you're trying to dodge a DMCA strike.",
  "Was that a cut or a cry for help?",
  "This is giving... filler episode.",
  "You're the background character in your own saga.",
  "You cut this like Buff dodges confrontation.",
  "This belongs on a cringe compilation, unironically.",
  "That slice was about as even as Tina’s mood swings.",
  "If LCU had a 'most likely to flop' award, you’d win.",
  "You're cutting like Knightmare edits—blindfolded and mad."

var paMessages2 = [
  "You're not banned... yet.",
  "It’s almost even. Like Keem’s takes—*almost*.",
  "Better, but still not LCU-worthy.",
  "We see the effort. We don’t applaud it.",
  "A solid C-tier move. Mid-cut energy. Big Twiggy vibes.",
  "This belongs in a segment called 'Almost Respectable.'"
  ];
var paMessages3 = [
  "Half decent, unlike CD-Rom's show.",
  "Better than your last flop, barely.",
  "You're one livestream away from greatness.",
  "Almost cut that like Billy cuts bars.",
  "You might earn a W from Chat—just one."
  ];
var paMessages4 = [
  "You cut that like you're gunning for main host.",
  "Respectable. Zey might let you speak now.",
  "Even Xylie wouldn’t scream at that.",
  "You’ve unlocked Mid-Tier Legend status.",
  "Impressive. Not iconic, but impressive."
  ];
var paMessages5 = [
  "Perfect. You’ve greened the greys.",
  "That cut was so clean it needs a mod role, but it'll just get taken away for no reason...",
  "10/10. Someone call Bigfoot and Batgorl to REMIND us of this later.",
  "Flawless victory. Even the Rastov salutes you. But he don't like it!"
  ];
var paMessages5_1 = [
  "You didn’t cut. Did Boogie coach you?",
  "Imagine getting on stream  just to fumble like this.",
  "You literally missed. Not even metaphorically.",
  "We saw that. Chat saw that. No one’s impressed.",
  "Next time, try *doing* something.",
  "You forgot the point of the game. Again.",
  "This isn’t a cut—it’s a cry for attention. What is this dolls?",
  "Congratulations, you, like Aussy on the Breakdown, achieved... nothing."
